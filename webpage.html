<h3>This AI based project establishes a connection between the number of accidents and the circumstantial factors such as weather, speed limits, and  the type of road used. This can help public safety recognize which streets may need to be inproved in order to decrease the risk of accidents on that road or region. For example, though analysis done by this system, Surete du Quebec may find advantageus to modify speed limits, add more road signs, repair road specific roads that have increased accident risk.</h3>
<h3>The data was taken from Donnees Quebec (donneesquebec.ca) and were interconnected by time or place. For example, if we know that on a particular day, many accidents were commited on a certain street at a certain time, factors suchs as weather or incorrect street lights and signs may be an indicator of this sudden surmortality. Technically, the AI model was trained with tensorflow using a sequential model comprising seven dense layers (of around 2000 neurons each), along with some dropout layers, while taking ReLU as the activation function for all layers.</h3>
